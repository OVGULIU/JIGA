Julia for IsoGeometric Analysis

This document describes the implementation of a Finite Element Analysis program with isogeometric NURBS bases functions. The program is written in the Julia programming language.

The program and the associated documentation are preliminary efforts in establishing a robust computational framework that provides the ease of implementation of a high-level programming language, while not compromising on the primary objective of scientific computing -- speed and efficiency.
